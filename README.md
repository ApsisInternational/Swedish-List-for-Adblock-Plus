# Swedish List for Adblock Plus

An ABP-specific conversion of *[Frellwit's Swedish Filter](https://github.com/lassekongo83/Frellwits-filter-lists)*, since that list does not offer user support for Adblock Plus users.

Additionally, this conversion removes a lot of entry types that the Adblock Plus developer team is not happy-happy about having in regional lists, such as entries against anti-adblock, cookie notifications, social buttons, newsletters, paywalls, and push notification prompts.

The goal is for this list to be included in ABP no later than the end of October 2020, hopefully considerably earlier than it as well.
